\uc0\u9989  Structured pattern for risk distribution\
\uc0\u9989  Minimize player & prop overlap across parlays\

Pick #	Risk Level	Confidence	Notes\
1-8	\uc0\u55357 \u56594  LOCK	Highest	Must-hit, safest plays\
9-10	\uc0\u9989  SAFE	High	Slightly more risk than LOCK picks\

12	\uc0\u55357 \u56628  HIGH	Risky	High variance, big upside\
13-24	Repeat Pattern	Cycle back to 1-12	Ensures distribution balance\
\
\uc0\u55357 \u56589  Overlap & Distribution Strategy\
\
To fill 12 parlays, we need a strong mix of base props while ensuring:\
	\'95	Locks (\uc0\u55357 \u56594 ) appear in at least 75% of parlays\
	\'95	Safe Picks (\uc0\u9989 ) appear in at least 50%-75%\
	\'95	Moderate Picks (\uc0\u55357 \u57313 ) appear in 50%\
	\'95	High-Risk Picks (\uc0\u55357 \u56628 ) appear in <50%\
\
\uc0\u55357 \u56633  Overlap Suggestions:\
	\'95	Each player should appear in a maximum of 5-6 parlays\
	\'95	Each stat type (points, assists, etc.) should not exceed 5 parlays\
	\'95	High-risk picks should appear only in 4 or fewer parlays\
\
\uc0\u55357 \u56522  Final Count Breakdown (To Fill 12 Parlays Dynamically)\
\
Risk Level	Props Needed	% of Total Picks	Number of Parlay Appearances\
\uc0\u55357 \u56594  LOCK	8 Picks	33%	8-9 out of 12 parlays\
\uc0\u9989  SAFE	2 Picks	17%	6-8 out of 12 parlays\
\uc0\u55357 \u57313  MODERATE	1 Pick	8%	5-6 out of 12 parlays\
\uc0\u55357 \u56628  HIGH-RISK	1 Pick	8%	3-5 out of 12 parlays\
Cycle Repeats	13-24 Picks	Repeats Every 12 Picks	Evenly Distributed\
\
\uc0\u55357 \u56960  Thoughts & Next Steps\
\
\uc0\u9989  This structure ensures diversification while allowing for a high number of safe picks\
\uc0\u9989  Player & prop overlap is controlled to prevent one bad game from ruining multiple parlays\
\uc0\u9989  The cycle repeats every 12 picks, making it scalable for any number of parlays\
\
\uc0\u55357 \u56481  Final Check Before Building Apple Numbers Sheet:\
	1.	Do you want an automated formula to distribute props into parlays based on this structure?\
	2.	Would you like the flexibility to adjust risk settings dynamically in Apple Numbers?\
	3.	Would you prefer a Google Sheets version first to verify layout before exporting to Numbers?\

\uc0\u9989  The cycle repeats every 12 picks, making it scalable for any number of parlays\
\
\uc0\u55357 \u56481  Final Check Before Building Apple Numbers Sheet:\
	1.	Do you want an automated formula to distribute props into parlays based on this structure?\
	2.	Would you like the flexibility to adjust risk settings dynamically in Apple Numbers?\
	3.	Would you prefer a Google Sheets version first to verify layout before exporting to Numbers?\

,,,,,,\
"(For LLM, script, or manual use)",,,,,,\
Base Picks Input:,,,,,,\
Locks: Must be included in at least 50% of parlays,,,,,,\
Safe Picks: Must be included in at least 75% of parlays,,,,,,\
Moderate Picks: Must be included in 50%-75% of parlays,,,,,,\
High-Risk Picks: Appear in less than 50% of parlays,,,,,,\
Dynamic Parlay Adjustments:,,,,,,\
If fewer picks are inputted \uc0\u8594  Fewer parlays generated,,,,,,\
If more picks are inputted \uc0\u8594  More parlays generated,,,,,,\
Overlapping player props are spread across different parlays to reduce risk,,,,,,\
